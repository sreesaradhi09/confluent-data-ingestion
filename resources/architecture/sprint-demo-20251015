GCS Config Generator — Simplifying Connector Configuration
• One-stop Python utility to generate GCS Source & Sink connector configs.
• Auto-creates Excel template with dropdown validations and examples.
• Users simply fill parameters — no JSON editing needed.
• Validates with Pydantic (schema, formats, cross-field rules).
• Converts Excel → deployment-ready JSON files.
• Handles boolean coercion, key normalization, sensitive field split.
• Extensible design — can integrate Terraform or REST deployment later.
• Eliminates manual errors, speeds up onboarding, and standardizes configs.

“Alright, so let me walk you through something we built to simplify our connector setup process — the GCS Config Generator.
Earlier, whenever we had to create a new GCS Source or Sink connector, it used to involve manually editing JSON files, double-checking key names, formats, and making sure nothing broke during deployment. It was error-prone, repetitive, and not very scalable.
So the idea was simple — what if we could just fill an Excel file and get a ready-to-deploy connector config out of it?
That’s what this module does. It has two key functions:
    •	First, it generates an Excel template — pre-formatted with dropdowns for environment, formats, booleans, and time intervals.
    •	Second, it reads the user’s input, validates every field using Pydantic rules, normalizes the keys, handles special cases like boolean values and time zones, and finally writes clean, deployment-ready JSON files for each connector.
If you look at the flow, it starts with the Excel template creator — the user fills in Common, Sink, and Source sheets, and then the script processes them into structured JSON configs. Sensitive fields like credentials are clearly marked, and everything else is standardized — no typos, no inconsistent key names.
We also added logic to handle flexible boolean inputs — users can type Yes, True, or even 1, and it automatically converts that to the correct format for Confluent Cloud.
From a reuse perspective, the code is modular — tomorrow, we can plug the same outputs into Terraform or CI/CD pipelines without any change.
In short, this tool automates what used to take hours into a couple of minutes. It ensures consistency across all connector deployments and reduces human error.
In the demo, I’ll show how we create a template, fill a few rows, and instantly generate validated JSON files. That’s the end-to-end story of the GCS Config Generator — small script, big productivity gain.”
